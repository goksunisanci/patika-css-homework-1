            <span class="hello">Hello.</span> I'm Göksu. My love of solving problems with formulas and mathematics lessons since primary school led
            me to the field of mathematics. The fact that I love children very much and that I can get along with them
            even more than adults led me to become a primary school teacher. Finally, my dreams of living abroad at the
            end of high school led me to METU. Thus, I found myself in the Department of Elementary Mathematics
            Education at METU. However, with the change of mind brought by the years, I decided to work in a different
            profession when I graduated. And since then, I have been trying to improve myself in the software field.
